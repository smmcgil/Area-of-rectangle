# Area-of-rectangle
Simple program to calculate the area of a rectangle on a coordinate plane.

Have the function ArrayChallenge(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will only contain 4 elements and be in the form (x y) where x and y are both integers, and return the area of the rectangle formed by the 4 points on a Cartesian grid. The 4 elements will be in arbitrary order.
